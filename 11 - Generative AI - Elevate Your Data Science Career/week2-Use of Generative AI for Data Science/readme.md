# Use of Generative AI for Data Science

In this module, you will explore the role of generative AI in data science. Lesson 1 will cover generative AI for understanding data and model building. You will learn how data scientists can use generative AI to visualize, develop, and build models. Lesson 2 will cover the use of generative AI for data science regarding tools and techniques to help in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and develop a predictive model. You will learn about the industry-specific considerations while using generative AI and the challenges data scientists face. You will also learn about the skills data scientists require to succeed in their field and how generative AI can help them hone those skills in today’s world.

## Learning Objectives
- Summarize the techniques that can help in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and list the tools that can help develop a predictive model.
- List the industry-specific considerations of using Generative AI.
- Discuss the three key challenges while using generative AI in data science.
- Summarize the skills data scientists require to succeed in their field and how generative AI can help them hone these skills in today’s world.


## Module 2 Summary: Use of Generative AI for Data Science
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that:

- Generative AI can help in EDA using various techniques, such as statistical data description, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, feature engineering, and hypothesis generation. 
- Generative AI plays a significant role in developing a predictive model using various techniques, such as selecting model architecture and important features, generating ensemble models, improving model interpretability and generalization, and preventing overfitting. 
- While using generative AI models, data scientists need to look into data, model, and ethical considerations.
- Data professionals face various technical, organizational, and cultural challenges when using Generative AI in multiple industries. 
- Being a successful data scientist requires several skills, such as mathematical and statistical skills, knowledge of programming languages, and an understanding of machine learning principles.
- Generative AI can help them hone these skills.
