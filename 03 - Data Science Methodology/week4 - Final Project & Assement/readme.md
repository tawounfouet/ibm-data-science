# Final Project Assessment

Before completing your final project, learn how CRISP-DM data science methodology compares to John Rollinsâ€™ foundational data science methodology. Then, apply what you learned to complete a peer-graded assignment using CRISP-DM data science methodology to solve a business problem you define. You'll first take on both the client and data scientist role and describe how you would apply CRISP-DM data science methodology to solve the business problem. Then, take on the role of a data scientist and apply your knowledge of CRISP-DM data methodology stages to describe how you would solve the business problem. After you submit your assignment, you'll grade the assignment of one peer who is enrolled in this session. Let's get started!
