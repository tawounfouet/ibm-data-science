# Module 2 - From Understanding to preparation and From Modeling to Evaluation

In this module, you will learn what data scientists do when their tasks and goals are to understand, prepare, and clean the data. You’ll examine the purposes, characteristics, and goals of the data modeling process. You’ll also explore how to prepare a data set by handling missing, invalid, or misleading data. Then check out the hands-on labs where you can gain experience completing tasks relevant to the Data Understanding, Data Preparation, and Modeling and Evaluation stages. You’ll be able to apply the skills you learn to future data science problems.

## Learning Objectives
- Prepare a data set by handling missing, invalid, or misleading data.
- Describe the purpose and characteristics of the data modeling process.
- Evaluate a decision tree model using a training and a test dataset.
- Build a decision to tree to determine the cuisine type for a data set of recipes.
- Summarize the processes of understanding data preparing data, modeling, and evaluation phases of the data science methodology.
