    <p>
      The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation based on the outcomes of all tasks in previous modules and labs.
      Your presentation will develop into a story of all your data science journey in this project, and it should be compelling and easy to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next exercise, you can find a provided PowerPoint template to help you get started to create a report in slides format.
      However, you are free to add additional slides, charts, and tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this presentation will be prepared for your peer-data-scientists whom are eager to understand every technical detail of this project.
      As such, this presentation will be much more detailed and technical than regular high-level and abstracted presentation for your executive team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have completed a detailed report, it should be straightforward for you to abstract it into a high-level
      deck for your executive team and/or stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>There are a total of 40 points possible for the final assessment, and you will be graded by your peers, who are also completing this assignment.</p>
